This is a cocotron master clone modified for osx sierra and tested with xcode 8.21

all downloads are provided as gz or zip files

see howto in InstallCDT

(issues:  in the texteditor example there is always a dos like extra window ???)


to ease things further i created an osx installer package that installs the cocotron developer tools and the latest cocotron master right in place.

(cocotron master is installed in users/shared)

i tested this package on virgin mavericks (xcode 6.2) and sierra (xcode 8.21) installs with no issues.

you can immediately start development without any shell script.

remarks for installer package:

if you want to execute an install script however you first have to install home.brew with preinstall.sh.

if you clean the hole project and try to recompile you get => “File exists and is not a symbolic link”. I could not find the reason for that

to solve this I had to delete the frameworks folder inside system/i386-mingw32msvc and recompile in this order => foundation, appkit and cocotron.
